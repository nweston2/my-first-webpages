                        As part of the course that helped me create this site, we were put in groups 
                        and simulated client/developer relationships. Each student was a client for 
                        their own website, a lead developer for someone else's site, and a junior 
                        developer for two additional sites.
                    </p>

                        I recently started creating bonsai as a hobby, so it was the logical content for 
                        my site. There is a plethora of images of bonsai online, so it was not difficult
                        to find images to use.

                    <p>
                        I communicated with my developer through email. We didn't have any major issues with 
                        communication, though I was not entirely satisfied with the results. Large parts of 
                        the content I provided to put in the website were not used and the colors I gave were
                        used seemingly at random. Next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I will need 
                        to find a better way to communicate my needs. There seems to be a delicate balance 
                        between giving too much creative licence and just making the site yourself before 
                        handing it over for nitpicks.

                        Email was the primary method of communication for this website. This is how I 
                        talked to my junior developers when I needed. I also used email to talk to the 
                        client.

                        Github worked well for us. I shared the link to the pages site with the client so 
                        she could monitor our progress and make any suggestions as we worked. Our work
                        came together seamlessly using github.

                        I was rather pleased with the outcome of the website. I had a hard time contacting
                        one of my junior developers. The content all made it into the site, but their
                        page is not formatted well. Aside from that, everything turned out well.

                        The first website on which I was a junior developer was an informational site 
                        about Star Wars. The main page is a chronological timeline of Star Wars and the 
                        child sites are about the clients favorite movies. I was in charge of the page 
                        about A New Hope.

                        The main issue I ran into was confusion about the site wireframe. The wireframe 
                        was very clear about what the client wanted, but my lead decided not to follow it
                        in the creation of the site. This made creating my site difficult because I had to 
                        create my page independent of the rest of the site in order to follow the client's 
                        instructions. Other than that, things went off without a hitch. We had no problems 
                        with communication or github that I am aware of. We used email as our primary form 
                        of communication. I think overall the website turned out pretty well.

                        The second site I was supposed to assist in developing had some issues with 
                        the client. We never recieved a site plan with any real information on what 
                        we were supposed to make. As you can probably imagine, this made it difficult 
                        to make. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
                    <p>
                        Overall I think the most difficult aspect of website creation is communication. Things 
                        go smoothly when everyone can converse and express their needs and confusions. When 
                        someone doesn't respond, however, things quickly become vastly more difficult. If I 
                        were to do the project again, I would probably get together with my teams and decide 
                        on a form of communication that works for everyone that we are all likely to be able 
                        to respond to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really liked this project. It was fun to work on a bunch of different websites, especially 
                        since some included content I would never think of making myself. I definitely feel more 
                        confident in my ability to work on real world projects after this experience. I was able 
                        to do good work, even with some complications. Given my new experiences, I even know some of 
                        the pitfalls of projects like this and can work to overcome similar future issues.
